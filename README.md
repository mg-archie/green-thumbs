# Green Thumbs

## Description

Green Thumbs is a comprehensive online platform where gardening enthusiasts can explore a diverse range of plants, save their favourites, and engage with a vibrant community through blog posts and comments. Share your gardening journey, learn from others, and cultivate a thriving online garden community at Green Thumbs.

Our motivation for developing Green Thumbs stemmed from a deep love for gardening and a desire to create a centralized platform where fellow enthusiasts could come together, share their passion, and learn from one another. We saw a need for a comprehensive website that not only provided information about various plants but also fostered a sense of community through user-generated content like blog posts. Our goal was to empower individuals to connect, inspire, and grow their gardening skills while building a supportive online community.
